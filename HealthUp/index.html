									<h2>Project Component #1: User Research</h2>
									<h3>Project Idea</h3>
									<p>Our project idea is the redesign a system we built in our database class. The purpose of the system is an all in one fitness progression tracking application. The application is meant to work in tandem with our database so that a user can create meal plans and add foods to these meal plans based on their macro nutritional/calorie goals. In addition to this, the application also allows the users to create workout routines, and keep track of the weights they use or the number of repetitions achieved for that workout. <br>
									<br>
									We expect our system to be used in a number of different ways. An important functionality for our system is the ability to create meal plans and track food consumption. The average user would be able to input their statistics (height, weight, etc) as well as their goals, and receive the information they require to reach their goals. This can include things like daily calorie limits or macro nutrient goals. In addition to this, users will be able to create workout routines as well as log their weight/repetitions as they complete each exercise in their routine. This allows our users to visually see their progression over time. Lastly, users should be able to do lookups into both the food and exercise database. A user could search the foods database to find new foods that fit their needs, or to log food they consume throughout the day. Similarly, a user could use the exercise database to search up new exercise by body part or by the equipment they have available. This allows users to have greater flexibility with their routines. <br>
									<br>
									Our typical user is meant to be anyone with a phone or computer who wishes to either track their progress, or plan ahead with regards to fitness and health. The only knowledge required to use the application is basic knowledge of phone and web page navigation. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Our target context is ideally both mobile and web-based. The app’s availability on mobile means that users can track on the go, specially since most of the people have smartphones nowadays. The ability to look up macronutrients whilst deciding on what to eat as well as tracking these is a huge selling point, and the same goes for the workout aspect of the app. Having our app available as a website introduces continuity. Users would be able to view their progression on a much larger screen, with a more detailed information provided. This would also allow users to be able to create meal plans and workout routines much more efficiently.

									<h3>Research Methods</h3>
									<h4>Method #1: Fly on the Wall</h4>
									</article>
                                    <p>Our first method of choice was the fly on the wall observation. We chose fly on the wall because it was easy to execute in a short period of time, and it gives us better view of what goes on at the gym that we don’t notice when we go in for our daily workouts. For the best possible result, we went on three different days, during peak hours. We have narrowed our observations down to the following: </p>
                                    <article>
                                    <a class="image"><img src="images/workout_journal.jpg" alt="" /></a>
                                    <div class="inner">
                                    <p>Even though we live in a technological age, we observed some individuals still using a journal or a piece of paper to track their exercises. Most of the fitness coach as well at the university’s fitness centre carry clipboards while training individuals. This observation stood out on people who compete as they can make changes to their exercises and numbers easily depending on how their workout is going. A few left spaces in their journals for comments about their workout. These comments are mainly used to give the person an idea about the future week’s workout. Some of the comments included; (but are not limited to) “Weight felt heavy but doable, stick to the same weight next week”, “Lack of sleep last night, felt weak/tired for the duration of the workout.” </p>
                                    </div>
                                    </article>
                                    <article>
                                    <div class="inner">
                                    <p>Secondly, during our observation the most prominent trend we witnessed at the gym was that gym goers more often than not, are on their phones between sets of exercise. Upon further inspection we learned that this was for a number reasons. The first of these reasons was to look up exercise routines. The featured picture is a reenactment of our observation. Typically newer gym members could be found on their phones searching up routines. This could be because they either wished for some direction in their workout, or they could not pull from memory the next exercise in their prescribed routine.</p>
                                    </div>
                                    <a class="image"><img src="images/irene.png" alt="" /></a>
                                    </article>
                                    <article>
                                    <a class="image"><img src="images/joe.png" alt="" /></a>
                                    <div class="inner">
                                    <p>Another reason for gym-goers being on their phones we witnessed was to lookup exercises or exercise alternatives. The mobile application ‘progression’ was seen being used by gym goers to perform lookups for alternative exercises. For instance, having used the app ourselves, the user can simply search the database for ‘Chest’ exercises and they are given a veritable smorgasbord of alternate exercises for them to utilize in their routine. Similarly, the application can be used to perform a search by equipment so a user can plan their routine accordingly based on the equipment available. As a bonus, each exercise in the application also has a diagram on how to perform the exercise. </p>
                                    </div>
                                    </article>
                                    <article>
                                    <div class="inner">
                                    <p>Gym goers were also found using their phones to watch videos. Specifically, videos on proper exercise form. A problem many gym goers face is ensuring they are using proper form when performing a movement. Proper form is one of the most important things regarding weight lifting when it comes to safety. Improper form can lead to poor performance, slow progression, and ultimately injury. In addition, not many gym goers can afford or have access to a trainer to ensure that they are performing an exercise correctly. Thus, the nearest and cheapest available alternative is to utilize information available online. </p>

									<h4>Method #2: Survey and Questionnaires</h4>
									<p>This method allowed us to further conduct research not observable by the fly on the wall method. It allowed us to ask and interact with individuals who use the gym, track progression, or log nutrition. The following images show the results of our survey and questionnaire.</p>
                                    </article>

										<h4>Gym Related Question</h4>
										<h5>Do you go to the gym regularly? (at least 2-3 times a week)</h5>
                                        <img src="images/f0.png" alt="" />

										<h4>Gym Related Question</h4>
										<h5>What about your gym progression do you keep track of?</h5>
                                        <img src="images/f1.png" alt="" />
                                        <p>When asked about what aspect of training our prospective users are most concerned about, we observe that there is a reasonably even split between strength, physique, and endurance. What this might mean is that the needs of gym goers are incredibly diverse and that there is a possible need for an all in one solution.<br>
<br>
When asked how our prospective users track their gym progression, it became more apparent how fragmented the market for fitness solutions is. A number of respondents reported using the app ‘Progression’. As well, others reported simply benchmarking their workouts. In contrast to this, some respondents report using visuals such as photos or simply a mirror to track their progress. Lastly, some reported simply using a weighing scale at regular intervals.

                                    <h4>Food Related Question</h4>
                                    <p>How conscious are you about your food intake?</p>
                                    <img src="images/f6.png" alt="" />

									<h4>Food Related Question</h4>
									<p>What about your food intake do you keep track of?</p>
                                    <img src="images/f7.png" alt="" />
                                    <p>When the same respondents were asked about their consciousness regarding their food intake, (1 being completely unaware and 5 being extremely health conscious) we observe that the majority of users are at least somewhat mindful about their diets. This is significant because this signals to us that, at least from our sample, most people who are mindful about the exercise aspect of fitness are also aware of the importance of a balanced diet. Thus, perhaps there be a need for an application that combines these aspects of fitness.<br>
</br>
When asked about what aspect of nutrition our respondents keeps track of, the major aspects were calorie count and macronutrients. As avid gym goers ourselves, this result was somewhat expected since this mirrors our own sentiments. The next largest group was the N/A group, followed by ‘Other’ and ‘Vitamins/Nutritional Value’. One reason for this could be because of the distribution of 3’s in the above bar graph. Perhaps there are users who are mindful of what they eat, but not to the extent of empirically keeping track of their food consumption

In short, what our survey tells us is that there is a market for an all in one fitness application that combines training and nutrition. However, what it also tells us is that, not all gym goers are avid dieters, and vice versa. Thus, this could mean an optimal solution is one built modularly so that users can use the training functionalities, or the nutrition functionalities, or both.
